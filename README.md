# Acronym
Acronym expansion tool.


Most updated version will always be found at <a href='https://jmoscato.com/acronym/' target="_blank">jmoscato.com/acronym</a>

I will not be updating this repo as often, so check there for most recent version.

Also be aware of the PowerShell script, cause I think that is pretty nifty too.

Images typically come from an images folder, they are in main directory here.
Paths in bkgr.js have been changed to reflect this.
Images are all from denvergov.org


Acronym count at time of last upload is 926.
