# acronym
Acronym expansion tool.


Most updated version will always be found at <a href='https://jmoscato.com/acronym/' target="_blank">jmoscato.com/acronym</a>

I will not be updating this tool as often, so check the URL for most recent version.

Also be aware of the PowerShell script, cause I think that is pretty nifty too.
